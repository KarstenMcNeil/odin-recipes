    <p>
        This is 100% Paula Deen's recipe for Banana Pudding, but for the sake of having an example of my work in this portfolio I am naming it after my wife. She makes this for holiday gatherings and the pan is gone before we leave. It's not too sweet and a <i>fantastic</i> as a midnight snack.
